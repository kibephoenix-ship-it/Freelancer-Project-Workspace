# Syncflow

Syncflow helps independent professionals manage clients, projects, proposals, and invoices in one focused workspace.

## Run & Operate

- `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run dev` — run the API server (port 5000)
- `pnpm run build` — build all packages
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push` — push DB schema changes (dev only)
- Required env: `DATABASE_URL` — Postgres connection string

## Stack

- pnpm workspaces, Node.js 24, JavaScript (ES modules and JSX)
- API: Express 5
- DB: PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM
- Validation: Zod (`zod/v4`), `drizzle-zod`
- Build: esbuild (CJS bundle)

## Where things live

_Populate as you build — short repo map plus pointers to the source-of-truth file for DB schema, API contracts, theme files, etc._

## Architecture decisions

_Populate as you build — non-obvious choices a reader couldn't infer from the code (3-5 bullets)._

## Product

_Describe the high-level user-facing capabilities of this app once they exist._

## User preferences

_Populate as you build — explicit user instructions worth remembering across sessions._

## Gotchas

_Populate as you build — sharp edges, "always run X before Y" rules._

## Pointers

- See the `pnpm-workspace` skill for workspace structure and package details
